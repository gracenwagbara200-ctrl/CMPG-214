# CMPG-214

* Greetings, my name is Grace Nwagbara
* I am an asspiring software developer, but I would also love to get a degree in Geology as it has alwas been a passion of mine.
* I am somewhat of a sport enthusiast, I have always participated in some kind of sport for a major part of my life. Starting with track and field in my junior years, then joining basketball, which I have fallen in love with over the past years.
* The 'Designing Yourself' assignment represents a way for me to showcase myself to people virtually without having to physically show them who I am at first (this is espesially helpfull to me as I would struggle to share who I trully am at times).
